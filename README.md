Using a csv file with election data we were able to process and execute the tasks that were provided. This will he us in our knowledge and understanding of Python and how its used.

## Challenge Summary
In summary we took a elections results data for 3 candidates,format the data to be organized and readable. Sparse throught he data collecting information on the candidates and the amount of votes they received along with the total vote number. With that info we were able to calcuate and display the results of the election which was then written to a test file for submission to the board of elections. Highlighting the candidates, their number votes and the percentage votes by county as well. Also spotlighted the winner of the election, their number votes and percentage of the votes in which was received to win.We could clearly see what county also had the largest turn out for the election. The script can be used in to determine not just the winner of an election, but also to see where voter turn is low and fpcus campainig efforts there to gain more support for the candidates. It also ca be used in mock election or exit polls for current status of candidates as seen through the voting public's eyes.
